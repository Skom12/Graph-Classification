# Graph-Classification
Classification of Albert Barabasi and Watts strogatz graphs using CNN. <br />
We use an artificial dataset containing 2500 Graphs generated by the Albert Barabasi and Watts Strogatz algorithms. <br />
We use Node2vec to generate graph embeddings. <br />
We projet the graph embeddings into the 2D space using t-SNE algorithm <br />
We transform the 2D embeddings into 2D Histograms. <br />
We use a 1D CNN for classification of the Histograms.
