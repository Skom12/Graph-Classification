# Graph-Classification
Classification of Albert Barabasi and Watts strogatz graphs using CNN
We use and artificial dataset containing 2500 Graphs generated by the Albert Barabasi and Watts Strogatz algorithms.
We use Node2vec to generate graph embeddings 
We projet the graph embeddings into the 2D space using t-SNE algorithm
We transform the 2D embeddings into 2D Histograms
We use a 1D CNN for classification of the Histograms.
